Теоретическое задание.
1) Какие есть виды тестирования. Расписать подробно о каждом.

Static testing - is a testing technique which is used to check defects in software application without executing the code. Includes: Informal reviews,
walkthroughs, technical review, inspection.

Dynamic testing - is a software testing method used to test the dynamic behaviour of software code. The main purpose of dynamic testing is to test software
with dynamic variables or variables which are not constant and finding weak areas in software runtime environment.
=================
White box testing - technique in which internal structure, design and ciding of software are tested to verify flow of input-output and to improve design,
usability and security. In white box testing, code is visible to testers.

Black box testing - testing method in which the functionalities of software applications are tested without having knowledge of internal code structure,
implementation details and internal path. BBT mainly focuses on input and output of software applications and it is entirely based on software requirements 
and specifications.

Gray box method - is a software testing technique to test a software product or application with partial knowledge of internal structure of the application.
The purpose of grey box testing is to search and identify the defects due to improper code structure or improper use of applications.
=================
Unit testing - is a type of testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose it ot validate that each unit of software code
performs as expected. Unit tests isolate a section of code and veirfy its correctness.

Integration testing - is defined as a type aof testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software
project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose defects in the interaction
between this software modules when they are integrated.

System testing - a test level that focuses on verifying that a systam as a whole meets specified requirements.
=================
smoke testing - testing that covers the main functionality of a component or system to determine whether it works properly before planned testing begins
=================
positive testing - is a type of testing which is performed on a software application by providing the valid data sets as an input. It check whether
the software application behaves as expected with positive inputs or not.

negative testing - a testing method performed on the software application by providing invalid or improper data sets as input. Ti checks whether
the software application behaves as expected with the negative or unwanted user inputs.
=================



2) Что такое авторизация, аутентификация, валидация, идентификация.

Authorization - is security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer
programs, data and applications features. This is the process of granting or denying access to a network resources which allows the user access to various
resources based on the user's identity.

Authentication - is the process of recognizing a user's identity. It is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying
credentials. The credentials provided are compared to those on a file in a database of the authorized user's information on a local operating system or 
within an authentication server.

Verification - is a process of checking documents, design, code and program in order to check if the software has been built according to the requirements or not.
The main goal of verification process is to ensure quality of software application, design, architecture etc. The verification involves activities like
reviews, walk-throughs and inspection.

Validation - is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating if the software product actually meets the exact needs of the customer or not. The process
helps to ensure that the software fulfills the desired use in an appropriate environment. The validation process involves activities like unit testing, integration testing,
system testing and user acceptance testing.

3) Распишите жизненный цикл бага.

Defect life cycle - in the special set of states that defect or bug goes through in its entire life. The purpose DLC is to easily coordinate and communicate
current status of defect which changes to various assigness and make the defect fixing process systematic and efficient.
Defect status or Bug status in defect life cycle is the present state from which the defect or a bug is currently undergoing. The goal of defect is to 
precisely convey the current state or progress of a defect or bug in order to better track and understand the actual progress of the defect life cycle.
The number of states that a defect goes through varies from project. Below lifecycle diagram, covers all possible states.
<NEW> When a new defect is logged and posted for the first time. It is assigned a status as NEW.
<ASSIGNED> Once the bug is posted by the tester, the lead of the tester approves the bug and assigns the bug to the developer team.
<OPEN> The developer starts analyzing and works on the defect fix.
<FIXED> When a developer makes a necessary code change and verifies the change, he or she can make bug status as "Fixed".
<PENDING RETEST> Once the defect is fixed the developer gives a particular code for retesting the code to the tester. Since the software testing
remains pending from the testers and, the status assigned is "pending retest".
<RETEST> Tester does the retesting of the code at this stage to check whether the defect is fixed by the developer or not and changes the status to "Re-test"
<VERIFIED> The tester re-tests the bug after it got fixed by the developer. If there is no bug detected in the software, then the bug is fixed and
the status assigned is "verified".
<REOPEN> If the bug persist even after the developer has fixed the bug, the tester changes the status to "reopened". Once again the bug goes through the LC.
<CLOSED> If the bug is no longer exists then tester assigns the status "Closed".
<DUPLICATE> If the defect is repeated twice or the defect corresponds to the same concept of the bug, the status is changed to "duplicate"/
<REJECTED> if the developer feels the defect is not a genuine defect then it changed the defect to "rejected".
<DEFERRED> If the present bug is not a prime priority and if it is expected to get fixed in the next release, then status "Deferred" is assigned to such bugs.
<NOT A BUG> If it does not affect the functionality of the application then the status assigned to a bug is "Not a bug".
